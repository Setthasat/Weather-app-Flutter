# Weather App Flutter
A weather application built with Flutter.

## Features
- Automatically detects user's current location
- Displays comprehensive weather data including:
  - Current temperature and feels-like temperature
  - Weather conditions with animated icons
  - Wind speed
  - Humidity levels
  - Atmospheric pressure
  - Visibility range
  - Cloud coverage
- Clean and minimal user interface
- Real-time weather updates

## Note
I created this application to practice fetching data from the OpenWeather API and implementing location services by requesting user permissions.
